## How to Run
### Build Requirements
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
3. Your own Google Maps API key

### Build Project
1. Open `public/src/index.html` and replace `?key=APIKEY` with your own Google API key to the maps.googleapis.com script
    - Google made changes to their Map API that now requires a billing account. Please do not use my account!
2. Navigate to the root of the project directory (where the `gulpfile.js` is located)
3. In your terminal enter the command: `npm install`, this will install all modules listed as dependencies in `package.json`
4. Enter the command `gulp clean` to delete everything in the `dist` folder.
    - If you want to preview what files will be deleted, enter the command `gulp cleanDryRun` instead.
5. Next enter the command `gulp` and the project will be built in the `dist` folder.
    - You can review differences by comparing the `src` and `dist` folder.
